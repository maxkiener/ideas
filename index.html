            <h1>Workshopping Ideas.</h1>
            <p>
                This page is an experiment and can be thought of as a Github for ideas. In the first stage I'll through some ideas out there and want to collect feedback on how to improve them. You can vote on them, or - even better - suggest specific improvements (for cases that are not considered or alterations that would make the idea better).<br>
                I'll get notified when you submit an improvement and can then approve it or reject it.<br>
                In this first phase, I have two goals: 1. I want to get feedback on these ideas below and 2. I want to improve this site and build it as a community idea improvement tool. Please send me your suggestion about how to make the page better in idea #5.
