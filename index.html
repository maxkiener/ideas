            <h1>Workshopping Ideas.</h1>
            <p>
                This page is an experiment and can be thought of as a Github for ideas. In the first stage I'll through some ideas out there and want to collect feedback on how to improve them. You can vote on them, or - even better - suggest specific improvements (for cases that are not considered or alterations that would make the idea better).<br>
                I'll get notified when you submit an improvement and can then approve it or reject it.<br>
                In this first phase, I have two goals: 1. I want to get feedback on these ideas below and 2. I want to improve this site and build it as a community idea improvement tool. Please send me your suggestion about how to make the page better in idea #5.  
            </p>

                <p>Introduce a "driving licence" for meat eating. Nothing wrong with eating meat. But if you do, you should be willing to kill an animal (which is what you are delegating when eating meat). <br> 
                    At age 15-20 people who want to eat meat should get a "meat licence", by killing an animal of their choice (pig, fish, chicken).</p>
